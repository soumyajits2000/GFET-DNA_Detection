# DNA Detection using Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs)
This project focuses on simulating and analyzing DNA detection using Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs). The goal is to investigate the potential of GFETs for DNA sensing and gain insights into their behavior and performance.

## Project Overview
The project involves:

Computational modeling techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation and numerical methods.
Calculating the electrostatic potential distribution and charge density in the GFET channel.
Analyzing the drain-source current (IDS) characteristics.
Visualizing the potential distribution and IDS-VG/IDS-VDS characteristics.

## Prerequisites
To run the simulation, you need:

MATLAB

## Usage
Clone the repository.
Open the MATLAB script.
Modify the parameters, such as channel dimensions, DNA properties, and applied voltages, as needed.
Run the script to simulate the DNA detection using GFETs.
View the generated plots for the potential distribution, IDS-VG characteristic, and IDS-VDS characteristic.

## Results
The simulation provides insights into the behavior of GFETs in the presence of DNA molecules. The potential distribution reveals the impact of DNA binding on the electrostatics. The IDS-VG characteristic demonstrates the relationship between the gate voltage and drain-source current, while the IDS-VDS characteristic shows the variation in current with different drain-source voltages.
